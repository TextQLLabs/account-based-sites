Chart CSS Framework:
```css
.chart-container {
    background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1);

    padding: 1rem;
    margin: 1rem 0;
}

.bar-chart {
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-end;

DATA EXTRACTION FROM RESEARCH:
- Current analysis costs and timelines
- Team sizes and hourly rates
- Frequency of similar investigations
- Industry-specific pain points
- Regulatory/compliance requirements
- Business questions commonly asked
- Technology stack and data sources

CALCULATION FORMULAS:
- Analysis Cost = Team Size √ó Hourly Rate √ó Timeline
- Annual Cost = Analysis Cost √ó Annual Frequency
- ROI = (Annual Savings + Risk Prevention) √∑ Implementation Cost
- Speed Increase = Current Timeline √∑ Future Timeline
- Cost Reduction = (Current Cost - Future Cost) √∑ Current Cost

OUTPUT FORMAT: 
Single HTML file with embedded CSS, optimized for dramatic before/after story presentation with the sample report prominently featured as proof of the transformation.
